# Assembly
<p>My labs and personal projects in ARM Assembly language. Labs from ECE253 Digital and Computer Systems course.</p>
<p><strong>ARMIntro:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Part 1: summed the elements of a positive list of numbers into R7</li>
    <li>Part 2: code which calculates the number of consecutive ones in a list</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PollingLab:&nbsp;</strong>Generate a sequence of LEDs with the pattern sweeping into the centre and back out again with 0.25s durations. Used polling with the counter and keys I/O. When key3 is pressed and unpressed again, the sweeping pattern stops, starts when pressed and unpressed again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>InterruptsLab:&nbsp;</strong>Use interrupts to repeat the sweeping LEDs triggered by a KEY lab above. </p>
